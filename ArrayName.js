/*const orages = [3, 4, 5, 6]; // address of the first value
orages.push(10);
console.log(orages);

// no error unit the address is not changed
orages = 10; // then error co reassigning the value means address willl change

// mrf--important--map,reduce, filter --- coz they will not mutate the array always returns a copy

orag_rev = orages.reverse(); // when we do reverse it effects the original list
console.log(orag_rev); // prints reversed one
console.log(orages); // reversed will get printed ---> called mutability ,
// so these two functions are mutable  so to avoid this we can use copy by value or using the methods wich are immutable means always returns a copy of the array
